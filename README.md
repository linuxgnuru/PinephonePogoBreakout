# PinephonePogoBreakout

This fork is to add a 0.9v-5v to 5v dc-dc step-up voltage boost so we can use the battery pogo pin when not connected to the usb-c plug.  It also adds sda / slc to the silk screen instead of just i2c twice

A breakout board for the Pinephone's expansion port, which consists of 6 pogo pins connected to I2C (SDA and SCL), the battery (at 3.8V), a 3.3V power rail (or is it 5V? Not confirmed yet), an interrupt pin, and GND.


I will go back and update the silkscreen layer to indicate which I2C pin is which, once I find out myself.

Also the standoff/washer .stl file is for 3d printing; it's used because I left the three holes in the pcb larger than necessary to allow some wiggle room, and the machine screw (which is M1.4 by the way) will slip through it otherwise.
